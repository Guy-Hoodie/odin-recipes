      <h2>How to make it</h2>
       <ol>
        <li>Combine pork, ginger, garlic, green onion, soy sauce, sesame oil,
             egg and cabbage in a large bowl. Stir until well mixed. </li>
        <li>Place 1 heaping teaspoon of pork filling onto each wonton skin.
            Moisten edges with water and fold edges over to form a triangle shape.
            Roll edges slightly to seal in filling.
            Set dumplings aside on a lightly floured surface until ready to cook.</li>
        <li>Arrange dumplings in a covered bamboo or metal steamer
            so they don't touch to prevent them from sticking together;
            steam until pork is cooked through, about 15 minutes.</li>
        <li>Serve hot and enjoy!</li>
       </ol>
